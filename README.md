[MyQ custom component](https://github.com/ehendrix23/hass_myq) for homeassistant

The myq cover platform lets you control MyQ-Enabled garage doors through Home Assistant. Device names in Home Assistant are generated based on the names defined in your MyQ Device mobile app.

### Binary Sensor

Your `MyQ` gateway will appear as a binary sensor that shows if the device is connected.

### Cover

Garage doors and gates linked to your `MyQ` account will appear as covers.
